Hello contact, I am Polina, from Russia, living in the USA.
Some days ago I found your profile on Badoo and surprisingly decided to write to you :-)
So, here I am. I must say you are very cute and I would like to know you more!
Lets write to each other, my email  is anetabacv@rambler.ru, write to me and I will send some of my photos.
Cheers,
Polina
